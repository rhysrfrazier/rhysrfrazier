### Welcome!

My name's Rhys (pronounced like Reese's Cups) and my pronouns are he/him or they/them, interchangeably. I'm a driven junior software engineer with two major goals:
- Continue improving my technical skills indefinitely (learning new and improved techniques; more languages and frameworks as appropriate; broader and deeper understanding!)
- Contribute to accessible software that helps improve the lives of users

I have the most experience in the MERN stack, but also dabble in a bit of Python3, C#, and PostgreSQL.

I'm currently working on a full portfolio website, but please feel free to check out the pinned repos in the meantime! I can't wait to have more time to revisit and improve these in the coming weeks, but until then.

Feel free to reach out here or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhysrfrazier/) if you have any questions, feedback, ir just want to connect.
