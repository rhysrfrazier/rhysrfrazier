### Welcome!

My name's Rhys (pronounced like Reese's Cups) and my pronouns are he/him or they/them, interchangeably. I'm a driven junior software engineer with two major goals:
- Continue improving my technical skills indefinitely (learning new and improved techniques; more languages and frameworks as appropriate; broader and deeper understanding!)
- Contribute to accessible software that helps improve the lives of users

I have the most experience in the MERN stack, but also dabble in a bit of Python3, C#, and PostgreSQL.

Feel free to check out any of my pinned repos and reach out on LinkedIn if you'd like to get in touch!
