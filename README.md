### Welcome!

My name's Rhys (pronounced like Reese's Cups) and my pronouns are he/him or they/them, interchangeably. I'm a driven technical writer with two major goals:
- Continue improving my skills and learning indefinitely.
- Contribute to accessible products and services that helps improve the lives of users.

I'm also a hobbiest coder, working primarily with Next.js and PostgreSQL (by way of Sequelize).
